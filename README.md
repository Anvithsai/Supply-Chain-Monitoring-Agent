# 🚚 Supply Chain Monitoring Agent
### AIML Lab Assignment — AI Agent Design with Pipeline Architecture

An end-to-end AI pipeline that predicts supply chain delivery delays and generates intelligent, rule-based recommendations for every order using the **DataCo Supply Chain Dataset** from Kaggle.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Over 54.8% of orders in the DataCo dataset are delivered late, causing significant operational and financial losses. This project builds an **AI-based Supply Chain Monitoring Agent** that:

- Cleans and preprocesses raw logistics data
- Engineers meaningful delay-related features
- Trains a machine learning model to predict delivery delay probability
- Assigns risk levels (Low / Medium / High) to every order
- Generates actionable recommendations to prevent delays before they happen

### `3_delay_prediction.ipynb` — Delay Prediction Model

**Input:** `Datasets/processed_data.csv` + `Datasets/feature_cols.json`  
**Output:** `models/delay_model.pkl` + `Datasets/predictions.csv`

What this notebook does, step by step:

- **Section 0:** Imports scikit-learn classifiers (`RandomForestClassifier`, `GradientBoostingClassifier`, `LogisticRegression`), metrics, `pickle`, `json`, `os`; creates `models/` directory with `os.makedirs`
- **Section 1:** Loads processed data (180,519 × 28); reads feature list from `feature_cols.json`; prints target balance — Late: 98,977 | On-time: 81,542

  - **Random Forest Classifier** — primary model, selected as best
- **Section 4 — Evaluation of best model (Random Forest):**
  - Confusion matrix heatmap (seaborn)
  - ROC curve with AUC score
  - Full classification report (Precision, Recall, F1 per class)

### `4_agent_logic.ipynb` — Risk Scoring + AI Agent Logic

**Input:** `Datasets/predictions.csv` (180,519 × 31)

What this notebook does, step by step:

- **Section 0:** Imports pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn; sets plot theme
- **Section 1:** Loads predictions file; confirms 180,519 × 31 shape; previews `delay_probability` statistics (mean=0.516, min=0.015, max=0.999)
- **Section 2 — Risk Scoring:** Defines thresholds (`LOW_THRESHOLD = 0.30`, `HIGH_THRESHOLD = 0.70`) and maps every order's `delay_probability` to a `risk_level`:

| Delay Probability | Risk Level | Count | Share |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 0.30 | LOW | 9,165 | 5.1% |
| 0.30 – 0.70 | MEDIUM | 112,477 | 62.3% |
| > 0.70 | HIGH | 58,877 | 32.6% |

- **Section 3 — Agent Rule Engine:** Applies multi-condition if-else rules to assign a human-readable `recommendation` to each order. Key rules:

| Condition | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| risk_level = HIGH | 🔴 High Delay Risk: Switch to Faster Shipping Mode |
| risk_level = MEDIUM + high_discount_flag = 1 | 🟡 Discounted Order with Moderate Risk: Verify Fulfilment |
| risk_level = MEDIUM (general) | 🟡 Moderate Delay Risk: Flag for Supervisor Review |
| risk_level = LOW | 🟢 Low Risk: No Immediate Action Required |

- **Section 4:** Validates agent outputs — bar chart of actual late rate within each risk bucket; horizontal bar chart of all recommendation types and their order counts
- **Section 5 — Save:** Saves `final_output.csv` with 10 interpretable columns: `Order Id`, `Sales`, `Order Profit Per Order`, `Order Item Quantity`, `Days for shipment (scheduled)`, `Late_delivery_risk`, `delay_probability`, `predicted_late`, `risk_level`, `recommendation`

**Agent Summary (printed at end of notebook):**

```
Total orders processed :  180,519
HIGH risk orders       :   58,877
MEDIUM risk orders     :  112,477

## ▶️ Execution Order

**Run notebooks strictly in this sequence. Do not skip steps.**

```
Step 1 → 1_data_preprocessing.ipynb    reads raw_data.csv      → writes cleaned_data.csv
Step 2 → 2_feature_engineering.ipynb   reads cleaned_data.csv  → writes processed_data.csv + feature_cols.json
Step 3 → 3_delay_prediction.ipynb      reads processed_data.csv → writes delay_model.pkl + predictions.csv
Step 4 → 4_agent_logic.ipynb           reads predictions.csv   → writes final_output.csv
Step 5 → 5_visualization.ipynb         reads final_output.csv  → writes dashboard.png + prints insights
```

> ⚠️ **Critical:** Each notebook reads the output of the previous one. Running out of order or skipping a step will cause a `FileNotFoundError`. Always complete each notebook fully (all cells run, no errors) before opening the next.

## ⚖️ Ethical & Societal Relevance

- **Transparency:** All agent recommendations are rule-based and fully auditable. Every decision traces back to an explicit probability threshold and a named condition — no black-box outputs.
- **Bias Awareness:** The model uses historical late-delivery rates per region, market, and product category as features. These encode real patterns but may also reflect structural disparities. Results should be reviewed periodically to ensure no region or segment is systematically penalised.
- **Fairness:** Risk scoring applies uniform probability thresholds across all orders regardless of customer identity or location, ensuring consistent treatment.
- **Data Privacy:** Customer names, emails, passwords, and other personally identifiable information are dropped in Notebook 1 and are never used in modelling.
- **Societal Benefit:** Reducing supply chain delays improves reliability for end consumers, particularly in healthcare, food, and essential goods sectors. Smarter re-routing also reduces unnecessary expedited shipments, contributing to lower carbon emissions.
- **Economic Impact:** Proactive delay prediction enables intervention before shipments fail, protecting business revenue, preventing financial penalties, and maintaining customer trust.
